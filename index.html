                    <h2>Intro</h2>
                    <p>Teach For America has been a wild ride! I entered the Corp in 2017 and was placed in Kansas City, MO #TFAKCFAM. When I first arrived I knew noone in this city. I felt worlds away from my friends and family. I technically didn't have a job yet and I was low on savings. I was naive, but so full of hope. It has been one of the hardest expereices of my life, but so worth it. I have learned so much over the past couple of years and wanted to take some time to share my expereince. Plus, I had to make this website for my coding class... so enjoy this brief trip through the past two years of my life!!</p>

                    <h2>Induction</h2>
                    <p>Induction was the beginning of everything. I remember it vividly. We had to be there the tuesday after memorial day. I was still living out in Provo, UT at the time as I had just graduated BYU two weeks before. I packed up all that I owened at the time and piled it into my mini SUV and drove from UT to MO. I slept at my friend's parent's houses as I made the 16 hour drive (thank you to those gracious families who took me in never having met me before). I was alone. It was the first time I had ever done anything like that on my own. It was both liberating and terrifying at the same time. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>On tuesday we checked in to the 816 hotel in Westport, Kansas City, MO. We toured Kansas City on coaches, learned about the inequity in eduaction and talked about our stories of self. The rest is all a bit of a blur. There was so much inforamtion coming at us and then Friday we all made our own way to Houston for summer institute. </p>

                    <h2>Institute</h2>
                    <p>Oh Institute. First of all, Houston in the summer... not exactly  my favorite. So hot, so humid, so not my city. Second, what the hell even happened down there? 
                    </p><br>
                    <p>Institute was 5 weeks of teaching summer school at a local Houston school and then taking grad level classes in the afternnon. Then we would grab dinner and spend the rest of the night lesson planning. Well some of us would. There were other nights where we would blow of steam or explore downtown Houston. Most days I would get up at 5AM and head to breakfast, grab a sack lunch and then climb the school bus.</p><br>
                    <p>Really what you need to know about Houston is that it was hot, sweaty and totally overwhelming! There were some perks though, good friends, good fajitas and really cute 5th graders that I got to teach.</p><br>

                    <h2>Kick Off</h2>
                    <p>Kickoff was a the end of summer and right before I started wotk at my palcement school, Brookside. It was full of last minute prep, pep talks and uncertainty. I think it is when I started wondering what I had gotten myself into. I was still full of hope, but anxiety was starting to set in. So much was unknown.</p><br>
                    <p>Right after Kickoff, was new teacher induction at Brookside. Again it was another whirwind experience. Lots of information. It was overwhelming realizing that I was going to be the adult in charge of these children. It was my job to not only teach them, but to keep them safe. This is whem it started to hit me that teachers have a lot of responsibility.</p><br>
                    <p>New teacher induction was only a few days and then it was time for back to school conferences and to set up our classroom. Thinking back on that time is almost cringe worthy. I was so naive and thankfully I learned a lot that first year.</p>

                        <h2>Year One</h2>
                        <p>How do I summarize my first year into three paragraphs? Well, let's start with the good. </p><br>
                        <p>First, Mr. Cole Ware was my wonderful, patient co-teacher. God bless that man. If you are reading this, thank you for putting up with me! Cole and I are complete opposites, in personality and in the way we work. I am sure I drove him insane on more than one occasion. Second, my patient, loving students. How they learned anything in our classroom that first year I will never know. I am so greateful that they were resilient and tenacious! Third, my amazing coworkers that kept me going through everything. God bless them as well and the person that I was that they had to deal with. And last, but not least, my amazing roommate, Tiana. I loved out Greys Anatomy nights, out QT runs and our snow day dance parties.</p><br>
                        <p>Now for the tough. Teaching my first year was like that scene from Tangled where she is so excited she has left her tower, but then so worried that she has made the wrong decison. Essentially what I am saying that I was not emotionally stable my first year of teaching. I was exhausted all the time, physically and emotionally. I second guessed my decision to teach almost everyday. I did more managing of behavior than I did teaching most days. I cried myself to sleep and I cried in front of my class. Slightly embarassing, but it happened.</p><br>
                        <p>When that final bell rang at the end of the year, I was both sad, relieved and extremely proud of myself. I was excited for a few weeks off before preperation for my second year began. </p>

                <article class="year2-info">
                    <h2>Year Two</h2>
                    <p>Year two brought big changes into my life. Dear Cole and I were seperated into individual classrooms,which was a new challenge for us both. I also had the priveledge of teaching STEAM and the opportunity to explore coding.</p><br>
                    <p>There were so many great opportunities the way of my students and I. I had the opportunity to start a Girls Who Code club at my school, we had guest speakers from the tech industry in class and we took a field trip to "Cupcakes and Coding". My students and I explored computer science principles and learned how to build websites together. It was a lot of fun.</p><br>
                    <p>Year two brought great friendships. Year one I kept to myself a lot, but year two I started excepting more invitations to events. I got to know my #tfakcfam and found my tribe. I will forever be grateful for the amazing friendships I have made here in Kansas City. I am in awe of these amazing friends that are changing the world in their own unique ways. They're amazing. End of.</p><br>
                    <p>There was a lot of soul searching and personal growth during year two. I read "Brave, Not Perfect" by Reshma Saujani and it was life changing. There was a lot of self-actualization and thanks to my friends and #tfakcfam I was encouraged to follow dreams that I have had, but was too afraid to pursue before. Year two was still increibly hard, but it was a little less survival mode than year one and it was extrememly enlightening.</p>

                    <h2>Year 3</h2>
                    <p>Who knew there would be a year 3? I became a TFA Alum in April, but I decided to teach one more year at my placement school. I never could have imagined all the amazing things that would happen this year, and we are only half way through it.</p><br>
                    <p>Professionally this had been a fantastic year. Teaching has been a lot easier this year. Still hard, but easier. I have had many opportunities to work on my coding skills (like this website for my coding class). I also had an amazing experience competing in TFA Shark Tank: Teacher Edition (more on that later). I am humbled by the opportunities that I have had and can't wait to see what the future will bring.</p><br>
                    <p>Personally it has been a huge time of change. A lot of my tribe moved to different parts of the country. I still stay in touch with them, but it is hard when people move. Luckily I have amazing coworkers that I have had the opportunity to get closer to this year. They have been my saving grace. </p><br>
                    <p>So far year three has been great, and I am excited to see how the rest of the year plays out. I am not sure if my future will be here in Kansas City or if it will take me to another new city, but I am full of hope and excitment.</p>

                    <h2>TFA Shark Tank: Teacher Edition</h2>
                    <p>This has been one wild ride! Shark Tank was one of the bravest and greatest things that I have ever done. It took a lot to prepare for and I was nervous leading up to the event, but what a glorious night it turned out to be. For those who don't know, TFA Shark Tank: Teacher Edition was an opportunity for classroom teachers to pitch ideas that they needed funding for. There were four sharks in charge of deciding who got a cut of $20,000. Contestents pitched the idea to the audeince and then turned around and engaged in a Q&A with the sharks. I pitched a city-wide hackathon for middle school and high school aged girls. I have been inspried by my students and my own coding journey. I believe that if I had seen more women developers I would have seen myself in the industry sooner. This project for me is a huge passion. I was lucky enough to recieve full funding that night at TFA Shark Tank and now I working on hosting the hackathon in March. I am very excited about this project and the opportunities it will bring to young women across the KC metro.</p>
